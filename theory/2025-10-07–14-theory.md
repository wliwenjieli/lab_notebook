*Topic:* Geometry of Symbolic–World (S–W) Manifolds and Multimodal Representations  

---

## Concepts Developed
### 1. The S–W Framework
- **W** – the *world manifold*: high-dimensional, continuous sensory or embodied representations.  
- **S** – the *symbolic manifold*: low-dimensional, structured, often discrete conceptual space.  
- The mapping between them defines *grounding*:  
  - \( W \to S \): compression of continuous experience into symbolic abstraction.  
  - \( S \to W \): projection of symbolic structures into feasible world configurations.

**Advisor’s Note (paraphrased)**  
Variational-inference analogy (VAE re-parameterization):  
\( z = \mu + \sigma \cdot \epsilon, \; \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I) \)  
→ local isotropic vs anisotropic neighborhoods capture invariance vs equivariance in grounded symbols.

## Representational Formats
| Format | Encodes | Interpretation |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Centroid** | Prototype vector | Discrete prototypes (“cat” = 1 vector) |
| **Mean–Variance** | Probabilistic region | Fuzzy ellipsoids of tolerated variation |
| **Linear Subspace** | Structured patch | “Face” manifold with axes (pose, lighting, id.) |
| **Operator** | Transformations | “Move-right”, “rotate”, etc. |

Hierarchy: Centroid ⊂ Mean–Variance (Σ = 0); Linear-subspace = local geometry inside the region.

---

## Dual Roles
- **Mean–Variance:** defines *tolerance / invariance*.  
- **Linear Subspace:** defines *lawful internal variation / equivariance*.  
- Together → structured cloud describing both invariance and equivariance.

### Directions Around Centroids
- Meaningful directions = anisotropic variance → equivariance.  
- Isotropic variance → semantic invariance (noise).

---

## Neural Implementations
- **VAEs:** explicit mean–variance modeling.  
- **CNNs / ViTs / Transformers:** implicit local linear subspaces.  
- Modern ANNs behave as if maintaining structured concept clouds.

---

## CLIP as Example
- Shared embeddings for text & images (contrastive loss).  
- Text ≈ centroids; images ≈ samples (mean–variance cloud).  
- Anisotropic directions → meaningful variation.  
- After affine alignment (Procrustes), text & image manifolds nearly isomorphic (cos residual ≈ 0.05–0.15).  
→ CLIP approximates an aligned S–W manifold.

## Overall Summary
> Grounding aligns a continuous world manifold \(W\) with a structured symbolic manifold \(S\).  
> CLIP-like models realize an approximate shared geometry where symbolic centroids coincide with perceptual concept means, and 
local variance encodes meaningful feature variation.
